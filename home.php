                <p>Since as early as he 19th century, women have been involved in what has evolved into the computer science field today.</p>
                <p>Both our first algorithm intended for a computer <i>and</i> our first compiler were designed by women.</p>
                <p>Despite their involvement in the field from its very origin, as with many other fields, many of these women and their achievements are not widely known.</p>
                <p>This web page provides a background of some of these women and their achievements.</p>
